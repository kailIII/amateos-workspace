Shuffle uses Maven for building and dependency management.

Prerequisites

1) Maven 3.0.x - http://maven.apache.org/download.html
2) Google Protocol Buffer compiler - http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/downloads/list
3) Android SDK - http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html
4) Set environment variable ANDROID_HOME to the path of your installed Android SDK and add $ANDROID_HOME/tools as well as $ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools to your $PATH. (or on Windows %ANDROID_HOME%\tools and %ANDROID_HOME%\platform-tools).
 
I couldn't find c2dm or flurry sdk in any publicly available maven repository, so you'll need to install them manually.

From lib directory run...
mvn install:install-file -Dfile=c2dm-server.jar -Dsources=c2dm-server-src.jar -DgroupId=com.google.android.c2dm -DartifactId=c2dm-server -Dversion=1.5.5 -Dpackaging=jar
mvn install:install-file -Dfile=c2dm.jar -Dsources=c2dm-sources.jar -DgroupId=com.google.android.c2dm -DartifactId=c2dm -Dversion=1.5.5 -Dpackaging=jar
mvn install:install-file -Dfile=FlurryAgent.jar -DgroupId=com.flurry -DartifactId=flurry-sdk -Dversion=2.2.1 -Dpackaging=jar

Clone git repo from here https://github.com/mosabua/maven-android-sdk-deployer
Then from a shell in your local clone...
mvn clean install -N
cd extras
mvn clean install
#To compile from the command line, you'll also need to generate v3 since the maven android
#plugin is ignoring the exclude
mvn clean install -DPkg.Revision=3

To use Eclipse

Download the Google Eclipse plugin and the GWT and Google App Engine SDK versions corresponding to those currently used by Shuffle.
Android App

Install m2e-android connector from http://rgladwell.github.com/m2e-android/updates/master/
Follow instructions here: http://rgladwell.github.com/m2e-android/

Google App Engine project

Insall m2eclipse-wtp http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/m2eclipse-wtp
Install m2e connector for build-helper-maven-plugin This should happen automatically when you import a project that requires it. If not, you'll see an error in the POM. To install it, go to Window > Preferences > Discovery > Open Catalog and install the buildhelper connector, then re-import the project from scratch.

Import your maven project into eclipse using m2eclipse import wizard.

Troubleshooting

If you get the following error in Eclipse, in Project preferences > Google switch to using the GWT and GAE versions from Google rather than the ones in your local repository.
